You can see a sample of my mobile ordering app at: 

https://shopping-10043.web.app/

I solely designed and implemented this app in order to address what I saw as shortcomings in current digital menu and ordering applications for mobile devices. 
The excessive scrolling required to navigate to various parts of the menu is a significant burden to place on a customer that you would rather impress than frustrate.

I chose to provide two viewing modes(gallery and list) that use accordians to reduce overall page height by hiding functionality behind them that would otherwise
waste precious screen real estate. To further reduce page height, each screen consists of a distinct section of the menu, rather than all of them, which seems to be 
the norm.

To further streamline the typical browse and order routine, I added a search bar , accessible from the side menu. This way, if a customer knows what they want already,
they can search for it to save even more time, which typically means a better experience overall.

The frameworks used were ionic and angular. Message passing was implemented with rxjs subjects hosted within a singleton service, and firebase was used to host the db.
Given that this is implemented within another singleton service, switching to a different host such as aws or google cloud would be trivial.
